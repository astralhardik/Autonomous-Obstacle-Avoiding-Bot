# ü§ñ Autonomous Obstacle Avoiding Bot

An intelligent Arduino-based robot that can navigate autonomously by detecting and avoiding obstacles in its path using ultrasonic sensing and real-time decision making. This project was developed as part of the **Design Lab course** at **The LNM Institute of Information Technology (LNMIIT), Jaipur**.

## üìå Project Overview

This robot uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo motor to scan its environment. The Arduino Uno processes distance data and makes decisions to move forward, turn, or stop based on nearby obstacles. A liquid crystal display (LCD) is used to show the movement direction and status.
